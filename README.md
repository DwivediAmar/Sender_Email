It can be used to send email.<br>
<br>This Python script is a simple email sending application built with tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI) and smtplib for sending emails. It allows users to send an email with an optional attachment through a Gmail account. Users can input the sender's email, password, recipient's email, subject, body content, and attach a file using a file dialog. The program handles email creation, attachment encoding, and sending through Gmail's SMTP server.<br>
